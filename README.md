Grow: structure

For milestone 2 we created a web page that has links to different sections of our application. We have a garden page where users can
use currency in the form of water droplets to purchase flowers and plant them in their garden. Users can also name their garden. We
have a positivity park where users can visit different locations in the park to be tasked with various activities to earn water droplets.
We have a motivation menu with helpful tips whenever one needs a little something extra to keep them motivated. Our final page is a serene
sound center where users can play relaxing lofi beats that play accross the different sections of the browser.
