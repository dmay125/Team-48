            <p>Grow is a web application that utilizes interactive games to help users achieve their mental health goals. 
                Following the pandemic, issues such as anxiety and depression have become progressively more common. 
                Mental health awareness has become increasingly crucial as we navigate through the post-pandemic world and no one has to struggle alone.
                With Grow, we seek to foster a community of individuals focused on self-improvement and provide aid to those looking for healing and mental fortitude. 
                We want Grow to be a safe haven for all, a place where users can go and hone their self-care skills. Our web application will contain motivational tips, 
                calming music recommendations, daily reminders for positivity and much more.  A key feature of Grow is the interactive garden in which
                users can complete tasks such as breathing and meditation exercises to help their garden grow.
                With Grow users will be given the tools they need to confidently move through all of life’s ups and downs. </p>

            <div class="content">
            <p>Grow contains several key features that serve to help users improve their mental health.
                One key component of the application is the Motivation Menu, which will offer motivational tips.
                This will select a random tip and present it to the user. Tips will come in various categories such as “Affirmations”.
                Another vital feature is the Serene Sound Center, which provides calming music recommendations.
                Users can select a song from this menu or have the application play a random song.
                Additionally, the Positivity Park will present a reminder of positivity to the viewer each day. 
                Lastly, the main feature of Grow is Your Garden, an interactive garden which users can help grow by completing tasks such as breathing and meditation exercises.
                These important features each play an integral role in fulfilling the application's goal of fostering a healthy and positive community. </p>

                    The Serene Sound Center wireframe is designed to facilitate an easy music-listening experience. To keep the wireframe’s feature choice and placement 
                    familiar to users, we took inspiration from other music apps such as Spotify and YouTube to include a shuffle button, a previous song button, a play 
                    button, a next song button, and a repeat song button. We also included a search bar function to find songs and a list of available songs below that.

            <h2>Connecting to a Real-World Problem</h2>
            Grow is a free-to-use application that will provide support, community, and emergency contact services for users struggling with mental health. It would 
            be built to provide relief from mental health stress through completing tasks proven through studies to help people reduce stress and anxiety, such as daily 
            deep breathing exercises. The more tasks the user can complete, the more their virtual garden will grow. Being able to see tangible results through their 
            completed tasks can motivate the user to gain and maintain healthy habits. Grow will provide a user interface that is exciting to interact with while also 
            providing real-time communication with another human when the user is in need of someone to talk to. Our application’s aim is to make mental health resources 
            more accessible and engaging to interact with. 

            As students who had to have part of our college experience heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have gone through our own mental health struggles and 
            seek to help others like us cope with their struggles in a healthy and fun manner. We and many other college students have become accustomed to using online 
            platforms to distract ourselves from outward stress, but some applications offer distractions that can become unhealthy. This application will be low-commitment 
            for users such as college students who are busy otherwise with classwork and homework.

            <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
            The Grow project represents a prime example of the Integrative Experience, seamlessly blending insights from General Education and computer 
            science to confront real-world challenges. By incorporating knowledge from various fields such as technology, psychology, economics, and health, 
            the Grow team showcases the power of interdisciplinary collaboration in devising innovative solutions for issues like the lack of affordable and accessible 
            mental health resources. Central to the project's success is the emphasis on collaboration and advanced communication, essential skills honed through the 
            team's collaborative efforts. Working together, Grow team members integrate their diverse skill sets and perspectives to develop a cohesive and functional 
            platform, mirroring the dynamics of cross-disciplinary teams in professional settings. Furthermore, the project serves as a catalyst for critical thinking 
            and problem-solving within an interdisciplinary framework. Members are tasked with considering the broader implications of accessible healthcare and 
            navigating the technological intricacies of creating a user-friendly application. Through this process, students not only apply their prior learning but 
            also gain insights into the interconnectedness of different disciplines in addressing complex societal issues. The Grow project provides its members with a 
            tangible opportunity to apply their cumulative knowledge in a meaningful way, fostering a deeper understanding of their educational journey and preparing them 
            for lifelong engagement in addressing societal challenges.
