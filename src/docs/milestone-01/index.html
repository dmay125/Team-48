            <p>Grow is a web application that utilizes interactive games to help users achieve their mental health goals. Following
                the pandemic, issues such as anxiety and depression have become progressively more common. Mental health awareness has
                become increasingly crucial as we navigate through the post-pandemic world and no one has to struggle alone. With Grow, we
                seek to foster a community of individuals focused on self-improvement and provide aid to those looking for healing and
                mental fortitude. We want Grow to be a safe haven for all, a place where users can go and hone their self-care skills.
                Our web application will contain motivational tips, calming music recommendations, daily reminders for positivity and
                much more.  A key feature of Grow is the interactive garden in which users can complete tasks such as breathing and meditation
                exercises to help their garden grow. With Grow users will be given the tools they need to confidently move through all of
                life’s ups and downs.</p>

            <div class="content">
            <p>Grow contains several key features that serve to help users improve their mental health. One key component of the application
                is the Motivation Menu, which will offer motivational tips. This will select a random tip and present it to the user. Tips will
                come in various categories such as “Affirmations”. 
                
                <br><br>Another vital feature is the Serene Sound Center, which provides calming
                music recommendations. Users can select a song from this menu or have the application play a random song. 
                
                <br><br>Additionally, the Positivity Park will present a reminder of positivity to the viewer each day. 
                
                <br><br>Lastly, the main feature of Grow is Your Garden, an interactive garden which users can help grow by completing tasks such 
                as breathing and meditation exercises. 
                
                <br><br>These important features each play an integral role in fulfilling the application's goal of 
                fostering a healthy and positive community.

                To make Grow an entertaining and interactive web application for its users, it is important to obtain and display data to best suit the needs of the user. The most important aspect of Grow is that the user’s needs are properly accounted for. These needs differ from user to user. For that reason, the first type of data obtained from the Grow web application are user credentials. From there, the user will input data specific to them, such as their mood or their symptoms, and the application will output personalized data. Therefore, the top four types of data Grow will handle are: user credentials, music libraries and preferences, Grow Garden achievements, and a list of motivational tips.

                <br><br>The first type of data Grow will collect is user credentials. The login in page will have two options: login or create a new account. From there, the user will have a username and password unique to them. This way, Grow is personalized to the user. The user will be able to have their own music selection and garden achievements that are unique to them, making Grow a personalized and individualized experience. 

                <br><br>The next type of data Grow will handle is music libraries. Grow will import a selection of songs that will help the user regulate their emotions. This selection will include songs ranging from calm to upbeat, depending on the specific needs of the user. After either inputting symptoms or selecting a mood, Grow will display a list of unique songs which the user is able to play. 

                <br><br>Another type of data that Grow will handle are the Grow Garden achievements. By completing activities, the user will accumulate water droplets. These droplets can be used to water the flowers in the user’s Garden. This number will be stored as an integer that is unique to the individual user.

                <br><br>Another data type that Grow will handle is a list of motivational tips. This list will be generated by the Grow team after extensive research on helpful tips to improve mental health. One way for the user to obtain a tip is to press the randomly select button, in which Grow will display a random motivational tip.

                <br>In conclusion, the data types handled by Grow include but are not limited to: user credentials, music libraries, garden achievements and motivational tips. All of this data is individualized for each user so that they have a unique and personal experience while using Grow. This way, all users can have their needs accounted for.

                        button, a next song button, and a repeat song button. We also included a search bar function to find songs and a list of available songs below that.

            Grow is a free-to-use application that will provide support, community, and emergency contact services for users struggling with mental
            health. It would be built to provide relief from mental health stress through completing tasks proven through studies to help people
            reduce stress and anxiety, such as daily deep breathing exercises. The more tasks the user can complete, the more their virtual garden
            will grow. Being able to see tangible results through their completed tasks can motivate the user to gain and maintain healthy habits.
            Grow will provide a user interface that is exciting to interact with while also providing real-time communication with another human when
            the user is in need of someone to talk to. Our application’s aim is to make mental health resources more accessible and engaging to interact with.

            <br><br>As students who had to have part of our college experience heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have gone through our own mental
            health struggles and seek to help others like us cope with their struggles in a healthy and fun manner. We and many other college students
            have become accustomed to using online platforms to distract ourselves from outward stress, but some applications offer distractions that
            can become unhealthy. This application will be low-commitment for users such as college students who are busy otherwise with classwork and homework.

            The Grow project represents a prime example of the Integrative Experience, seamlessly blending insights from General Education and computer
            science to confront real-world challenges. By incorporating knowledge from various fields such as technology, psychology, economics, and health,
            the Grow team showcases the power of interdisciplinary collaboration in devising innovative solutions for issues like the lack of affordable and accessible
            mental health resources. Central to the project's success is the emphasis on collaboration and advanced communication, essential skills honed through the
            team's collaborative efforts. Working together, Grow team members integrate their diverse skill sets and perspectives to develop a cohesive and functional
            platform, mirroring the dynamics of cross-disciplinary teams in professional settings. Furthermore, the project serves as a catalyst for critical thinking
            and problem-solving within an interdisciplinary framework. Members are tasked with considering the broader implications of accessible healthcare and
            navigating the technological intricacies of creating a user-friendly application. Through this process, students not only apply their prior learning but
            also gain insights into the interconnectedness of different disciplines in addressing complex societal issues. The Grow project provides its members with a
            tangible opportunity to apply their cumulative knowledge in a meaningful way, fostering a deeper understanding of their educational journey and preparing them
            for lifelong engagement in addressing societal challenges.
