            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            Grow is a web application that utilizes interactive games to help users achieve their mental health goals. 
            Following the pandemic, issues such as anxiety and depression have become progressively more common. 
            Mental health awareness has become increasingly crucial as we navigate through the post-pandemic world and no one has to struggle alone.
            With Grow, we seek to foster a community of individuals focused on self-improvement and provide aid to those looking for healing and mental fortitude. 
            We want Grow to be a safe haven for all, a place where users can go and hone their self-care skills. Our web application will contain motivational tips, 
            calming music recommendations, daily reminders for positivity and much more.  A key feature of Grow is the interactive garden in which
            users can complete tasks such as breathing and meditation exercises to help their garden grow.
            With Grow users will be given the tools they need to confidently move through all of life’s ups and downs.
